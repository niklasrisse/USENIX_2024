# Models

We store the models separately from GitHub to reduce the size of the repository.

## How to download the models

1. You need an active Python installation with the package gdown. Follow the setup steps in our main [README.md](https://github.com/niklasrisse/USENIX2024/blob/main/README.md) to install this.

2. Download the compressed file from Google Drive
   `gdown 1MVo-pODa8kC4pKks2_YRfztO4loU-igs`

3. Unzip the compressed file in this directory (`models`)  
   `unzip VulBERTa.zip`

4. This will extract one directory for VulBERTa. The models for the other techniques (CoTexT, PLBart) will be downloaded while running the training scripts.

-   `VulBERTa`

5. Ready for usage.
